# Ascend Web Scrapper

## Overview

The Ascend Web Scrapper is a Node.js-based service designed for web scraping and data extraction tasks.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 21 or higher (Node Version Manager is recommended for easy version management).
- **Node Version Manager (NVM)**: For installing and managing multiple versions of Node. [Set up NVM by following these instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

---

---

## Additional Notes

Ensure youâ€™re using Node v21 or newer. If you have multiple Node versions installed, Node Version Manager (NVM) can help switch between versions easily. [Follow the NVM setup guide here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to install it.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Dependencies**: If `npm install` fails, try clearing the npm cache with `npm cache clean --force` and re-run the command.
- **Port Conflicts**: Make sure port 3000 is free. Use `lsof -i :3000` to check for processes using the same port.
